# Statistical-Analysis
Statistical analysis of 30 customers who ordered an EV scooter from Zen Automotives.
Customers age = [42, 44, 62, 35,20,30, 56, 20, 23, 41,55, 22, 31, 27, 66,21, 18, 24, 42, 25,32, 50, 31, 26, 36,39, 40, 18, 36, 22]

Q1. Compute the mean, median and the mode of the data
Q2. Compute the range , variance and standard deviation of customer ages
Q3. Find the mean deviation for the data . The mean deviation is defined as below.
Q4. Calculate the Pearson coefficient of skewness and comment on the skewness of the data
Q5. Count the number of data values that fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Compare this with the answer from Chebyshev’s Theorem.
Q6. Find the three quartiles and the interquartile range (IQR).
Q7. Are there any outliers in the data set ?
Q8. Draw a boxplot of the dataset to confirm .
Q9. Find the percentile rank of the datapoint 50.
Q10. What is the probability that a person ordering an EV scooter is above 50 years old?
Q11. Create a frequency distribution for the data and visualize it appropriately
Q12. Create a probability distribution of the data and visualize it appropriately.
Q13. What is the shape of the distribution of this dataset? Create an appropriate graph to determine that. Take 100 random samples with replacement from this dataset of size 5 each. Create a sampling distribution of the mean age of customers. Compare with other sampling distributions of sample size 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. State your observations. Does it corroborate the Central Limit Theorem?
Q14. Treat this dataset as a binomial distribution where p is the probability that a person ordering an EV is above 50 years age. What is the probability that out of a random sample of 10 buyers exactly 6 are above 50 years of age?
Q15. A study claims that 10% of all customers for an EV scooter are above 50 years of age. Using the Normal approximation of a Binomial distribution, find the probability that in a random sample of 300 prospective customers exactly 25 will be above 50 years of age.
Q16. Compute a 95% Confidence Interval for the true mean age of the population of EV scooter buyers for the dataset using appropriate distribution.( State reasons as to why did you use a z or t distribution)
Q17. A data scientist wants to estimate with 95% confidence the proportion of people who own an EV in the population. A recent study showed that 20% of people interviewed had an EV. The data scientist wants to be accurate within 2% of the true proportion. Find the minimum sample size necessary.
Q18. The same data scientist wants to estimate the proportion of executives who own an EV. She wants to be 90% confident and accurate within 5% of true proportion. Find the minimum sample size necessary.
Q19. A researcher claims that currently 20% of the population are owning EVs. Test his claim with an alpha =0.05 if out of a random sample of 30 two-wheeler owners only 5 own an EV.
Q20. Assume you are working for a Consumer Protection Agency that looks at complaints raised by customers for the transportation industry. Say you have been receiving complaints about the mileage of the latest EV launched by the Zen Automotives. Zen allows you to test randomly 40 of its new EVs to test mileage. Zen claims that the new EVs get a mileage of 96 kmpl on the highway. Your results show a mean of 91.3 kmpl and a standard deviation of 14.4.
a. Show why you support Zen’s claim using the P-value obtained.
b. After more complaints you decide to test the variability of the mileage on the highway. On questioning Zen’s quality control engineer , you find that they are claiming a standard deviation of 7.2. Test the claim about the standard deviation.
c. Write a summary of results and the action that Zen must take to remedy the complaints.
d. What is your position on performing the test for variability along with the test for means?
Q21. Write a report comparing and contrasting Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics in about 200-500 words and how each helps to get more insight into the data at hand
